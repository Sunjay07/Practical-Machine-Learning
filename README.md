#	We are required to create a report describing how the model was built, how the  #	cross validation was performed, what is the expected out of sample error and  #	explain the choices we make to support our analysis. #	The data for this project came from a fitness club in Rio, participating in the   #	Human activity project (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) .Six volunteers have  #	provided us the data from the devices they are wearing while they exercise. #	The goal of this prject is to predict the manner in which they exercised. This is #	the “classe” variable in the training set.
